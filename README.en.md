# GENAI Web (AI Interface)

## Deployment to Closed Network for Genai-Web

This project is a partially modified CDK version of the Digital Agency's [genai-web](https://github.com/digital-go-jp/genai-web), designed to operate in a closed network environment with private subnets only.

The main modifications are as follows.

### Porting CDK Code for GenU's Closed Network Mode

The CDK code related to the closed network mode of [Generative AI Use Cases (GenU)](https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-use-cases), which genai-web is based on (primarily the following code), has been ported:

- packages/cdk/fargate-s3-server/*
- packages/cdk/lib/construct/closedNetwork/*
- packages/cdk/lib/closed-network-stack.ts

As a result, the following architectural changes have been made from the original genai-web:

- The frontend interface has been changed from a CloudFront + WAF configuration to Application Load Balancer (ALB) + ECS (Fargate).
- Lambda has been changed to deploy inside the VPC.
- SAML-based Single Sign-On via Cognito has been removed, as it does not function in a closed network environment.
- Cognito self-signup has been removed, as the Cognito Hosted UI does not work with VPC endpoints.
- Transcribe's streaming API has been removed, as it does not work with VPC endpoints.

Additionally, for the team management feature that was added in genai-web (absent in GenU), the API Gateway serving as the endpoint has been changed to a Private REST API.

### About the Documentation

The documentation in this project is a modified version based on the Digital Agency's [genai-web](https://github.com/digital-go-jp/genai-web) and is provided under the CC BY 4.0 license.

The following is the content from the Digital Agency's original documentation.

## Overview

GENAI is a generative AI utilization platform developed and operated by the Digital Agency of Japan. It provides an environment in which government employees can quickly, securely, and easily use generative AI applications tailored to their work.

This project is based on the open-source [Generative AI Use Cases (GenU)](https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-use-cases) by Amazon Web Services (AWS), with the following modifications and additional features:

- Team management feature
- AI application management feature
- Ability to add and run generative AI applications built as external microservices
- Application of the [Digital Agency Design System](https://design.digital.go.jp/)
- Accessibility testing conducted by the in-house accessibility team
  - Some accessibility issues remain in the parameter adjustment feature shown after image generation on the image generation page
  - Other pages may also have remaining accessibility issues
- Addition of features required for operations (monitoring, etc.) and substantial changes to the codebase

Note that development is being carried out independently from GenU, and the feature set differs from GenU.
